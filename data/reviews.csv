NEW,924863440,My stay at Rydge's Camperdown,"I loved staying at Rydge's Camperdown. It was central to everything. The staff was amazing, and I got to do door dash that I do not have at home. :-) The only issue I have is that the receipt was not emailed as promised and I was charged for car parking but I never had a car with me, but that is just a small issue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d287023-r924863440-Reviews-Rydges_Camperdown-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html?m=66827#review924863440,287023,Rydges Camperdown,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255060-d287023-Reviews-Rydges_Camperdown-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html?m=66827,9 Missenden Rd,Camperdown,Sydney,New South Wales,Australia,2050,,,,3.0,856,$$
NEW,840163665,No quality at these apartments!,"Iam highly dissatisfied with my stay at Camperdown. The curtains had holes in them, toilet was broken and leaking, the apartment was generally neglected. Lights in kitchen were not working and bedside light was also Not working. At a cost of $329 for the stay the quality is unacceptable. Based on this experience I have cancelled another booking that I had planned for 3 nights the next week. We had booked in here to be close to the hospital and be comfortable during a stressful time and staying here has not helped! It really is disgraceful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d257306-r840163665-Reviews-Quality_Apartments_Camperdown-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html?m=66827#review840163665,257306,Quality Apartments Camperdown,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255060-d257306-Reviews-Quality_Apartments_Camperdown-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html?m=66827,23-33 Missenden Rd,Camperdown,Sydney,New South Wales,Australia,2050,,,,3.5,201,$$
